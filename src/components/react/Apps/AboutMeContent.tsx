				Hi, I’m Mikkel—front‑end tinkerer, bug whisperer and habitual over-commenter. I
				study Multimedia Design at KEA, live in Copenhagen, and have an unhealthy respect
				for Ctrl+Z. I build fast, clean interfaces with Astro, React, and Tailwind, and I’m
				on a lifelong quest to name variables better than “thing2.”
				<br />
				<br />
				Interests: clean UI, clever micro‑interactions, monospaced fonts with ligatures, and
				the occasional cybersecurity rabbit hole. Also: naming things badly so I can rename
				them later.
				<br />
				<br />I ship to Netlify, I read docs for fun, and I only break production once—per
				project. If you need someone who can design, build, and debug with equal enthusiasm,
				I’m your Mikkel. Bonus: my dog Bilbo provides moral support and unsolicited code
				reviews.
